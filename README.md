To learn more about our project, visit my website [Avodha Shopping](https://avodhashop.pythonanywhere.com/).

Django 2.2 is the framework used here, and Python 3.9 is the programming language (back-end). The front ends are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This option is available on the nav bar, and there is also the option if you click the third line there as well.
