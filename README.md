To learn more about our project, visit my website [Avodha Shopping](https://avodhashop.pythonanywhere.com/).

This project is a food delivery website. 
Django 2.2 is the framework used here, and Python 3.9 is the programming language (back-end). The front ends are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Only after you have logged in can you proceed to the next step. For that, there are two options. If you are a registered user, you can use "LOGIN", otherwise, "REGISTER". This option is available on the nav bar, and there is also the option if you click the "[hamburger menu](https://www.weareconflux.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Hamburger-Menu-Icons.png)" icon as well.
